# ElevateWebApp

This is a webapp project intended to be a prototype/ starter for a fully functioning ElevateEdu App. We intend to build code that is scalable and industry standard.
We hope to implement a calendar scheduling system like that of Tutorbird, include sms session reminders, and include scalability for other customizations and features for ElevateEdu.
