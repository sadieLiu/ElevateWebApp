# ElevateWebApp

This is a webapp project intended to be a prototype/ starter for a fully functioning ElevateEdu App. We intend to build code that is scalable and industry-standard.
We hope to implement a calendar scheduling system like that of Tutorbird, include sms session reminders, and include scalability for other customizations and features for ElevateEdu. The core of this project will be a scheduling functionality that takes in different user-defined datatypes (student, parent, tutor, scheduling manager) that reflect a tutoring center.
